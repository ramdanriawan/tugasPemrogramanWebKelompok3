<span class="dropcap ">D</span>on&#8217;t act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren&#8217;t on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There&#8217;s nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</p>
<p>Still, she&#8217;s got a lot of spirit. I don&#8217;t know, what do you think? What!? I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan&#8211; What good is a reward if you ain&#8217;t around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain&#8217;t my idea of courage. It&#8217;s more like…suicide.</p>
<p>She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There&#8217;ll be no one to stop us this time! You&#8217;re all clear, kid. Let&#8217;s blow this thing and go home! Partially, but it also obeys your commands.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dantooine. They&#8217;re on Dantooine.</li>
<li>He is here.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t underestimate the Force.</li>

<p>I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. <span class="highlight highlight-blue">But with the blast shield down,</span> I can&#8217;t even see! How am I supposed to fight? Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. But with the blast shield down, I can&#8217;t even see! How am I supposed to fight? You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!</p>

You don&#8217;t believe in the Force, do you? Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. I call it luck. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you&#8217;re going. What?! The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.</p>

<li>I care. So, what do you think of her, Han?</li>
<li>You mean it controls your actions?</li>

<li>I&#8217;m trying not to, kid.</li>

<p>You&#8217;re all clear, kid. <span class="highlight highlight-green">Let&#8217;s blow this thing and go home!</span> But with the blast shield down, I can&#8217;t even see! How am I supposed to fight? Alderaan? I&#8217;m not going to Alderaan. I&#8217;ve got to go home. It&#8217;s late, I&#8217;m in for it as it is.<br />
